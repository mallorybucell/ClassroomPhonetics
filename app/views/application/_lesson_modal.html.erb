          <p>You can think of a lesson like a paper worksheet. It is a series of (interactive) tasks the student can complete to show knowledge on a subject.</p>
          <p>These tasks are called <strong>exercises</strong>.</p>
          <p> Create a lesson and then assign it each student to do individually, or as a class activity.</p>
          <p>After the student <strong>submits</strong> the exercise, you can provide them feedback on each exercise in the lesson.</p>
